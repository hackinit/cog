# Development

## Setup
- Set up a Python2
[virtualenv](http://python-guide-pt-br.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/)
to manage Python dependencies 
- Source your virtualenv
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies
- Install [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) to run a database locally
  - If you're using Mac, install *Postgres.app* from
  [here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- Set three environment variables:
  - `DATABASE_URL` points to the URL of a development database,
which has to be set up using Postgres on your system. A sample `DATABASE_URL`
could look like `postgres://username:password@localhost/cog`.
  - `QUILL` is the URL to your Quill instance for auth.
  - `SECRET` needs to be the same JWT secret used in your Quill instance.
- Run `python initialize.py`
  - This initializes the database - run it if you make any changes to the models and
  are fine with overwriting data.

## Running
- Run `make run`
- The site will be visible at `localhost:8000`

## Tests
- Run `make test` to run all tests
